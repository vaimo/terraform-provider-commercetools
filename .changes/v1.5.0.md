## v1.5.0 (2022-09-30)

 - `resource_state_transitions` New resource to manage transitions between states.
   This was previously part of the `resource_state` but that made it imposible
   to have recursive transitions. This means that `transitions` attribute is now
   removed from the `resource_state` resource.

   example:
  ```hcl
    // Only allow transition from sale to clearance
    resource "commercetools_state_transitions" "transition-1" {
      from = commercetools_state.product_for_sale.id
      to = [
        commercetools_state.product_clearance.id,
      ]
    }
  ```
  See #86 for more information
 - `resource_shipping_zone_rate` Add support for `price_function` when the type
   is `CartScore` (#202)
