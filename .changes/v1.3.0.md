## v1.3.0 (2022-08-03)

  - **Backwards incompatible** Use a list type for enum values instead of a map
    to keep the ordering intact. This change requires an update to the way the
    values are defined (#98, #278):

      ```hcl
      type {
        name = "enum"
        values {
          FLAG-1 = "Flag 1"
          FLAG-2 = "Flag 2"
        }
      }
      ```

      to

      ```hcl
      type {
        name = "enum"
        value {
          key   = "FLAG-1"
          label = "Flag 1"
        }
        value {
          key   = "FLAG-2"
          label = "FLAG-2"
        }
      }
      ```

 - Update documentation and examples
 - Add support for custom fields on category, channel, customer_group,
   discount_code, shipping_method and store resources. (#265)
 - Improve logic to set the user-agent used in the requests. We now use the
   provider version. For example:
     `User-Agent: terraform-provider-commercetools/1.3.0 (bd9cae0)`
 - Improve the error handling by better communicating the errors raised by
   commercetools.
 - Accept a trailing slash in the token url (#182)
 - Large rewrite of the `type` and `product_type` resources to fix a number
   of issues (#165, #262, #263, #267)
